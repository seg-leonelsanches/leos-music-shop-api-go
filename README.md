# Leo's Music Shop API in Go (Gin)

This is another very cool API for Leo's Music Shop.

For now this API only sells keyboards and pianos.

## Motivation

This can help in Golang integrations with our clients. 

## Architecture

- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [gin-swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger)
- [Godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)
- [Gorm](https://gorm.io/)
- [Swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)

## Running

First create a `.env` file with the following:

```ini
SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY=your-source-write-key
```

Install all required packages:

```sh
go get .
```

Then run it:

```sh
go run .
```

Swagger is available at http://localhost:3001/swagger/index.html. 

## Modifying this project

The Swagger docs are generated by Swag. If you need to update the endpoints, make sure you re-generate the Swagger docs accordingly. 

You'll need to install Swag globally:

```sh
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

Then run:

```sh
swag init
```
